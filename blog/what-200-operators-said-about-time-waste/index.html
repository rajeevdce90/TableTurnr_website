<p>Across interviews, one theme repeated: managers spend too much time assembling context and too little time coaching execution. The most frequent phrase was, “I know the issue exists, but I cannot prove it fast enough to act.”</p>
<h2>Top time drains</h2>
<ul>
<li>Cross-checking POS, labor, and delivery performance manually</li>
<li>Explaining the same numbers in multiple meeting formats</li>
<li>Chasing approvals because owner is unclear</li>
<li>Late discovery of cost drift and stock risks</li>
</ul>
<p>Teams recovered time when the daily dashboard became role-based. Shift leads saw shift actions. GMs saw store-level drivers. Directors saw cross-location variance. Different views, same source.</p>
<p>The takeaway is operational, not technical: information should arrive in decision order. If not, people spend the day translating reports instead of improving service.</p>
<h2>Detailed operator checklist</h2>
<ul>
<li>Track manager time spent on reporting vs coaching each week.</li>
<li>Consolidate duplicate reports into one role-based daily brief.</li>
<li>Audit recurring manual tasks and automate the top three.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Common execution mistakes</h2>
<p>Teams focus on tool count reduction only. The larger win is removing decision friction for frontline roles.</p>

<p>The owner was profitable on paper but inconsistent in reality. One month looked strong, the next looked soft, and no one could explain the swing quickly enough to fix it. The turning point was not a new promotion or menu redesign. It was operating cadence.</p>
<p>They introduced a weekly scorecard with margin drivers: labor utilization, waste, discount leakage, and mix shift. Every variance got an owner and a date. Every Monday started with the same review, and every Friday closed with outcomes.</p>
<h2>What changed first</h2>
<ul><li>Overtime hotspots were visible by store and role.</li><li>Low-margin menu items were promoted less during peak labor windows.</li><li>Purchase timing aligned to forecast, not habit.</li></ul>
<p>By month three, margin improved to 11.8%. By month six, the location held 14% with better service consistency. The lesson: results improved when teams spent less time debating numbers and more time acting on them.</p>
<h2>Detailed operator checklist</h2>
<ul>
<li>Set a weekly margin review with the same scorecard each location.</li>
<li>Separate structural issues from one-time noise before action.</li>
<li>Track action completion rate, not just KPI trend.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Common execution mistakes</h2>
<p>Franchise teams often chase every variance. Better results come from prioritizing repeatable high-impact leaks first.</p>

<p>The director’s weekly call used to be 80% explanation and 20% decision. Store managers arrived with different numbers from different systems. By the time the call aligned facts, there was little room left for action.</p>
<p>After switching to a common operating dashboard, meetings changed format: ten-minute summary, twenty-minute exceptions, and twenty-minute commitments by owner and deadline.</p>
<h2>What improved</h2>
<ul>
<li>Same-day visibility into sales/labor variance by location.</li>
<li>Faster escalation on cost drift and inventory risk.</li>
<li>Clearer coaching because everyone discussed one source of truth.</li>
</ul>
<p>The director did not need longer meetings. They needed cleaner inputs. Better meeting quality came from pre-aligned context, not new presentation style.</p>
<h2>Detailed operator checklist</h2>
<ul>
<li>Send one pre-read view to all participants before weekly calls.</li>
<li>Reserve meeting time for exception handling and decisions only.</li>
<li>Track closed actions by owner and due date each week.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Common execution mistakes</h2>
<p>Leaders often add more meeting time instead of improving pre-meeting data alignment. Better inputs create better meetings.</p>

<section class="section"><div class="container" style="max-width:820px">
<h2>Day 1: Connect and align</h2>
<p>The first day focuses on system wiring and operational context. POS, labor sources, and core item mappings are connected. Managers confirm role visibility and location-level boundaries. By end of day, teams can see baseline dashboards and validate data flow.</p>
<h2>Day 2: Route and activate</h2>
<p>The second day is about action. Alert thresholds are tuned, ownership rules are assigned, and daily routines are rehearsed. Teams test common scenarios: labor variance, inventory risk, and demand spikes.</p>
<h2>What success looks like by hour 48</h2>
<ul>
<li>Managers receive role-based morning briefs.</li>
<li>Priority alerts are routed to the right owner.</li>
<li>Shift leads understand what to monitor during service.</li>
<li>Leadership has one operating view across locations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fast launch works when setup and behavior are handled together. Technology goes live quickly, but operating rhythm is what makes value stick.</p>
<h2>Detailed operator checklist</h2>
<ul>
<li>Prepare data owners and source access before kickoff day.</li>
<li>Validate role permissions with real users before launch.</li>
<li>Run one full day simulation with alert routing before go-live.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Common execution mistakes</h2>
<p>Fast launches fail when behavior design is skipped. Technical setup and role routines must go live together.</p>
